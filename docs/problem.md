# Problem Statement: School Nutrition Access and Subsidy Distribution in Sri Lanka

## Context & Pain Point

School children in Sri Lanka, particularly in rural and low-income communities, face significant barriers in accessing nutritious meals and government nutrition subsidies. Current challenges include:

### Who is Affected
- **Primary**: 4.2 million school children across 10,000+ government schools
- **Secondary**: Parents/guardians struggling with meal planning and costs
- **Tertiary**: School administrators managing canteen operations manually

### Key Problems
1. **Limited Visibility**: Children and parents are unaware of available subsidized meal programs
2. **Manual Processes**: Paper-based subsidy applications and meal ordering systems
3. **Nutritional Gaps**: Lack of nutritional guidance and meal planning support
4. **Payment Friction**: Difficulty in processing government subsidies and parent payments
5. **Poor Feedback Loop**: No mechanism to improve meal quality based on student feedback

## Evidence & Impact

- **Government Data**: Only 60% of eligible students access available nutrition subsidies
- **School Surveys**: 73% of schools still use manual meal management systems
- **Parent Feedback**: 45% report difficulty in tracking their children's nutritional intake
- **Health Impact**: 25% of school children show signs of malnutrition despite available programs

## Scope of Solution

Our solution targets the digital transformation of school meal management across government schools, focusing on:
- SLUDI-authenticated access for students, parents, and school staff
- Real-time nutrition data exchange via NDX
- Seamless subsidy distribution through PayDPI
- Analytics and feedback systems for continuous improvement

The immediate scope covers 5 pilot schools with 2,500 students, with plans to scale district-wide within 6 months.
